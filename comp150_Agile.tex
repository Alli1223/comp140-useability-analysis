\section{Game controller and Evaluation}

The game controller was a minimalist design because the controls for the game were fairly simple. It featured directional buttons, and a trigger button at the end which made the player attack. The controller went through a few iterations before coming to it's final design. The initial design was made out of playdough and had a lot of issues due to the playdough being conductive. For the second sprint the controller was re-designed out of cardboard and paper, with electrical paint for the directional arrows, and playdough for the trigger button.

\section{Recommended improvements}

Improvement one:
a more ergonomic design

Improvement two:
Another button was needed for the block mechanic.
